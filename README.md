# Data Mining, Computer Science, Winter Semester, 2016-17

How you can use this repo:

* we will post in this README general information about the course and announcements
* you can communicate with us (Lothar or Juanmi) or your classmates via issues. Reference specific people with a @handle or write general questions/comments.
* _Please avoid email_
* Use this [repo's wiki](https://github.com/Rostlab/DM_CS_WS_2016-17/wiki) for learning about different topics or submitting your own knowledge resources if you find it beneficial for your classmates.

This repo will grow progressively as the course advances. You can get an idea of how it will look like in the end in this past course: https://github.com/Rostlab/PP2_CS_WS_2015-16

Likely, we will have an individual repo for every dataset/group of the class.

Be awesome :-)
